### Live Demo: https://company-web.runasp.net/

### üí° Overview  
This is a comprehensive full-stack application featuring a **Blazor frontend** and an **ASP.NET Web API backend**, designed to efficiently manage employee data within an organization. The project is structured to provide a scalable and maintainable solution with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend user interface and the backend API services. Key components include:  

- **Frontend (Blazor)**:  
  - Interactive pages such as Create, Delete, Edit, Index, Home, Imports, and App, built using Blazor for a responsive and dynamic user experience.  
  - Utilizes Razor syntax for component-based architecture, ensuring reusable and modular code.  
  - Includes a MainLayout.razor and NavMenu.razor for consistent navigation and layout across the application.  

- **Backend (ASP.NET Web API)**:  
  - **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses, managing CRUD operations for employee data.  
  - **Data Application Context**: Configured with Entity Framework Core to interact with the database, ensuring efficient data persistence.  
  - **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Define data structures for transferring employee data between the client and server, enhancing security and performance.  
  - **Migrations**: Support database schema evolution, allowing seamless updates to the data model.  
  - **Models**: Represent employee entities with properties such as ID, name, department, and role, mapped to the database.  
  - **Repository Pattern**: Implements a repository with concrete classes and interfaces (e.g., IEmployeeRepository, EmployeeRepository) for data access, promoting testability and maintainability.  

- **Configuration**: Includes settings in appsettings.json for database connections, API keys, and environment-specific configurations, along with a Program.cs file to bootstrap the application.  
- **Static Assets**: Contains CSS, JavaScript, favicon, and icon files for styling and branding.  
- **Publishing Profile**: Configured via PublishProfile for deployment. 

The system leverages a clean architecture, ensuring a robust backend for data management and an intuitive frontend for user interaction, suitable for small to medium-sized enterprises.  

### ‚ú® Features
